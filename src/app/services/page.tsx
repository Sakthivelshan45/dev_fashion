  {
    q: "Do you offer same-day or 1-day delivery?",
    a: "Yes! Dev Fashion offers 1-day delivery for urgent bridal orders. Whether your wedding is tomorrow or you need a last-minute blouse for a function, our experienced team of 10 artisans can turn around quality work in 24 hours. WhatsApp us on 80985 58923 with your requirement and we'll confirm availability for your date."
  },
  {
    q: "How do I book a consultation with Ms. Durga Devi?",
    a: "You can walk into our studio at 9th Street, Tata Bed, Gandhipuram, Coimbatore, or call/WhatsApp us on 80985 58923 to book an appointment. Ms. Durga Devi, with her 17 years of expertise, personally oversees complex and bridal orders. Our team is available all days from 9 AM to 8 PM."
  },
  {
    q: "What are your prices?",
    a: "Our blouses start from ₹1,999 for cut work designs, ₹2,800 for aari embroidery, and ₹4,500+ for heavy zardosi bridal work. Pricing depends on the design complexity, embellishments and fabric. WhatsApp us or visit our studio for a free quote based on your specific saree and design requirement."
  },
  {
    q: "How do virtual appointments work for international or NRI clients?",
    a: "Once you schedule an appointment, we conduct a video call (WhatsApp/Zoom) where you describe your design requirements and view our fabric catalogs. We then guide you step-by-step on camera to take accurate body measurements. We also accept your favorite fitting blouse shipped to us as a physical size reference."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you ship internationally?",
    a: "Absolutely. We serve brides in 10+ countries including UAE, UK, USA, Canada, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Germany and Qatar. Simply WhatsApp us your measurements, saree details and design reference — our international orders team will coordinate everything, including safe packaging and tracked shipping to your doorstep abroad."
  },
  {
    q: "What is your standard tailoring turnaround time?",
    a: "Standard custom stitching takes 7 to 10 business days from the date measurements and fabrics are finalized. For bridalwear and highly intricate hand embroidery, it takes 3 to 6 weeks. We also offer expedited express tailoring (2-3 days) for urgent requests."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you supply fabrics, or do I need to send mine?",
    a: "We offer both options! We stock a premium range of fabrics (pure silk, Banarasi, velvet, georgette, and organza) that you can select from. Alternatively, you can drop off or mail your own fabrics to our Coimbatore studio."
  },
  {
    q: "What is your Perfect Fit Guarantee?",
    a: "If your outfit does not fit as expected, we offer free alteration fittings until it fits perfectly. For international clients, we keep large internal margins (up to 2 inches) inside the garment so it can be easily adjusted locally if needed."
  },
  {
    q: "Is client privacy maintained for designs and measurements?",
    a: "Absolutely. We treat all client measurements, custom outfit designs, and contact information with the highest confidentiality. We never share your physical measurement logs or private event references without explicit permission."
